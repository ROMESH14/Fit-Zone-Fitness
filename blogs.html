          <p>
            Discover beginner workouts that build your base...
            <span class="more-text"> If you're new to fitness, starting with full-body workouts is a great way to build a strong foundation. 
                Try these five essential moves: squats, lunges, pushups, planks, and dumbbell rows. 
                These exercises target all major muscle groups, helping you develop strength, stability, and endurance.
                 Aim for 3 sets of each to get your heart rate up and your body moving. Keep your form clean, rest as needed, 
                 and most importantly—stay consistent!</span>

          <h3>Strength Training Basics</h3>
          <p>
            Want to get strong? Start here...
            <span class="more-text">Want to get strong? Start with the basics of strength training by focusing on compound lifts like squats,
                 deadlifts, and bench presses. These movements work multiple muscle groups at once, making your workouts more efficient and effective.
                  Prioritize perfecting your form first—good technique is key to avoiding injury and maximizing gains. Once your form is solid,
                   gradually increase the weight to continue building strength over time.</span>

          <h3>Macros 101: What You Need to Know</h3>
          <p>
            Proteins, fats, and carbs explained...
            <span class="more-text">Macros 101: Here is what you need to know. Your body runs on three main macronutrients—protein, carbs, and fats.
                 Protein helps repair and build muscle, carbs give you energy for workouts and daily activities, 
                 and healthy fats support hormone function and overall health. Understanding and tracking your macros 
                 can make a big difference in reaching your fitness or weight goals faster. Balance is key, so aim to get the 
                 right amounts of each based on your personal needs.</span>

          <p>
            Consistency beats motivation...
            <span class="more-text">Staying consistent at the gym is the real secret to results. Motivation comes and goes, 
                but a solid routine keeps you on track. Set a workout schedule that fits your lifestyle, track your progress to 
                see how far you ve come, and always remind yourself why you started. Building habits takes time, but once they're in place,
                 showing up gets easier—and that is when the real transformation begins.</span>
